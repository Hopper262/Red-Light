Red Light version 1.1
by Hopper

The wait is over -- you no longer need to decide between playing "Red Light, Green Light" or shooting someone in the face.

Add this script to your regular netgame, and you'll have a global stoplight in effect. If you move or fire during a red light, you'll be killed by the omnipotent Marathon Traffic Cop, so be sure to stop when you hear the siren.

Don't host with the "netscript" gametype, just add it to your regular game of EMFH or whatever.

Problems? Don't ask me, I dunno.

Version 1.1 adds a message when someone runs the light, adds a red-light sound, and adjusts some of the wait times. A version with different sounds is included for use with M1A1. Thanks to Sharkie Lino and his play-testing crew for the changes.
